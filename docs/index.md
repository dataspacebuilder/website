# Trusted Data Sharing Stack

> **Enable digital ecosystems at scale**

## The Challenge of Modern Data Sharing

Organizations across industries face a common challenge: sharing data with partners, suppliers, and customers while maintaining control, ensuring compliance. Traditional approaches—proprietary Electronic (EDI) systems, point-to-point integrations, or manual data exchanges don't scale, because the contractural agreements are written on paper and can't be enforced digitally. In the era of AI and data-driven innovations, the decisions we made with AI we need to traced back to trusted data sources.

The **Eclipse Dataspace Components** (EDC) Stack is a comprehensive set of components built on open standards that enables organizations to participate in secure, sovereign data exchanges without the complexity of building everything from scratch.

## The EDC Stack at a Glance

### Core Components

| Component | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Classic EDC Connector**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector) | The fundamental building block containing Control Plane and Data Plane for point-to-point data sharing. |
| [**Identity Hub**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub) | Manages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (wallets) to establish trust. |
| [**Federated Catalog**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/FederatedCatalog) | Aggregates metadata from multiple connectors to allow looking up data offers across the dataspace. |
| [**CFM** — Connector Fabric Manager](https://github.com/Metaform/connector-fabric-manager) | The backbone for managing tenant lifecycle, workflows, and infrastructure provisioning at scale. |
| [**EDC-V** — Virtualized EDC](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Virtual-Connector) | Multi-tenant control plane enabling thousands of organizations to share a common infrastructure efficiently. |
| [**Data Plane Signaling (DPS)**](https://github.com/eclipse-dataplane-signaling/dataplane-signaling) | Enables the separation of the Control Plane from the Data Plane, allowing remote execution of data transfers. |
| [**Industrial Data Planes**](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-CloudLibrary) | Specialized data movement engines for industrial protocols (OPC UA, MQTT, etc.). |
| **Management UIs** | Interfaces for Manufacturers ([End-User API](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/End-User-API)) and CSPs ([Redline](https://github.com/Metaform/redline)). |
| [**Protocol TCKs**](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspacetck/dsp-tck) | Technology Compatibility Kits to validate that components conform to Dataspace Protocols (DSP, DCP). |

### How It Works

1. **Onboarding** — Operating companies and credential issuers manage organizational identity and trust using the [**Identity Hub**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub) and decentralized registries.
2. **Tenant Management** — Automated provisioning and lifecycle management for participating organizations. Proven tools like the [**Connector Fabric Manager (CFM)**](https://github.com/Metaform/connector-fabric-manager) handle scale effortlessly.
3. **Operational Experience** — User-friendly interfaces for both platform operators and end users. [**Redline**](https://github.com/Metaform/redline) and the [**End-User API**](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/End-User-API) provide the necessary control.
4. **Industrial Use Cases** — Pluggable [**Data Planes**](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-CloudLibrary) supporting diverse industrial data exchange scenarios.

## Built on Open Standards

The Trusted Data Sharing Stack implements industry-standard protocols:

| Standard                                      | Purpose                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dataspace Protocol (DSP)**            | Catalog discovery, contract negotiation, and transfer coordination |
| **Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP)** | Identity verification using DIDs and Verifiable Credentials        |
| **Data Plane Signaling (DPS)**          | Decoupled, high-performance data movement                          |

These standards are maintained by the [Eclipse Dataspace Working Group](https://dataspace.eclipse.org/) and have reached production stability with the DSP 2025-1 release.

## Real-World Deployments

Organizations across industries are already using these components:

- **Automotive** — Catena-X supply chain data exchange
- **Manufacturing** — Manufacturing-X industrial collaboration
- **Aerospace & Defence** — DECADE-X trusted supply chain ecosystem
- **European Cloud Providers** — Multi-provider dataspace federations
