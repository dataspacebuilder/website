## Style Guidelines

For visual consistency across all blog images:

1. **Color palette:** Stick to your layer colors
   - Purple (#7C3AED) - Trust & Governance
   - Green (#10B981) - Identity & Verification  
   - Teal (#0D9488) - Control & Negotiation
   - Orange (#F59E0B) - Data Transfer & Action
   - Navy (#1E3A5F) - Infrastructure & Foundation

2. **Elements to include:**
   - Network nodes and connections
   - Geometric shapes (circles, hexagons)
   - Abstract data flow visualizations
   - Cloud infrastructure motifs
   - Clean, professional aesthetic

3. **Elements to avoid:**
   - Overly literal server/hardware images
   - Stock photo feel
   - Busy or cluttered compositions
   - Outdated tech imagery
   - Generic cloud clip art

4. **Mood:** Professional, modern, trustworthy, innovative
